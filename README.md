# Time-Series-Forecasting

This project was built as part of NUS Fintech's internal Kaggle competition.
The goal was to conduct price forecasting on NVIDIA stock.
There are 2 implementations, one being a ARIMA model more grounded in statistics and the other being a stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network.
